Project Name: VOVID

Project Description: 

In the span of just five months, the COVID-19 pandemic has induced harm to over 6 million people and murdered over 367,000 worldwide. The United States of America constitutes over 33% of these cases alone. According to Stat News, people over the age of 50 are at grave danger, as their immune systems are less capable of fighting this lethal virus. 

In the United States, nearly 29% of all senior citizens live alone, and about 50% of those are over the age of 85. With the COVID-19 rampant in the streets, it is difficult for them to acquire essential needs without running the risk of contracting the virus. To solve this problem, I created an IOS Application ( & Delivery Platform) that provides a common platform for elders or food banks to connect with any volunteers who are willing to donate & deliver based on the requirements. With this extremely intuitive application, worried elders can acquire essential necessities without having to leave their homes

The app has two personas: Citizen/Individual Requestor and Volunteer

Citizen/Individual Requestor: As an individual requestor, after you sign up or log in and enter the app, you will be asked to enter items (maximum of 5 for volunteer's convenience) that you need and set a delivery location. Upon acceptance of your order, you will receive a notification and constant updates of the location of the volunteer who is delivering your stuff. Upon delivery, you are obligated to pay for your goods and so you will be prompted to a pay pal link. Quick and Simple!

Volunteer: As a volunteer, after you sign up or log in and enter the app, you will receive a list of all orders, sorted from nearest to furthest based on your location. You will be able to view the requestors location and their order. Upon acceptance, you will receive detailed navigation instructions to get to the delivery location. You will also be able to look at near grocery stores for your convenience, in case you're in an unfamiliar area. 

By harnessing the power of the good in the youth, we are able to keep the elderly indoors, and away from this virus, thus preventing the further spread of it.
